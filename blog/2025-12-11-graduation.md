# Apache Wayang Graduates to a Top-Level Project!

The Apache Wayang community is proud to announce a major milestone in our journey: **Apache Wayang has officially graduated from the Apache Incubator and is now a Top-Level Project (TLP) at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)**!

This graduation rewards the community-driven effort, research, innovation, and collaboration of many years. It reflects our shared commitment to open-source development and the growing importance of cross-platform data processing in the broader data ecosystem nowadays.
Graduating as an Apache Top-Level Project is an important recognition of the project’s maturity and ensures that Apache Wayang is backed by the full support and oversight of the ASF, guaranteeing openness, meritocracy, and a sustainable development model for years to come.

## What Is Apache Wayang?

Apache Wayang (formerly known as Rheem) is a **cross-platform data processing system** designed to give developers and organizations a unified way to execute pipelines over multiple data processing engines—such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, PostgreSQL, and more.

Instead of forcing users to choose a single execution backend, Wayang:

- **Abstracts data processing engines** through a unified API  
- **Can automatically choose the best execution platform** based on workload characteristics  
- **Optimizes performance** by distributing tasks across engines if necessary
- **Provides a flexible plugin architecture** for integrating new platforms and optimizers  

In other words, Wayang enables interoperability across the diverse data landscape and empowers teams to focus on application logic and not infrastructure decisions.

## Thank You to Our Community

Apache Wayang wouldn’t exist without its community of developers, users, mentors, and advocates who contributed code, documentation, feedback, and support. A special thanks goes to our Incubator mentors, who helped guide the project through the Apache processes and best practices.
Your contributions made this milestone possible, and we’re just getting started.
